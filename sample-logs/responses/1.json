The time when a change occurred is tracked separately from when the change\n   was recorded\n\n2. The state of an entity (a view) can be queried for any point in time to\n   fetch the values of fields in that entity at that point in time\n\n3. A change that occurred in the past should affect all views of the entity\n   that are requested after that point in time\n\n4. The end user should not have to declare changes but instead just edits the\n   entity as a whole at a given point in time\n\n## CRDTs\n\nRef: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type\n\nTypically used for resolving conflicts between information created from two different sources, we are able to use CRDTs for our usecase by treating a change made to an entity's history as a change from a disconnected user that's converging with other changes.\n\n### LWW Element Set\n\nRef: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type#LWW-Element-Set_(Last-Write-Wins-Element-Set)\n\nAn LWW Element Set is a well known CRDT. It consists of an 'add set', 'remove\nset' and a time stamp for each element in it.\n\nThe timestamp will be the time at which the change occurred. The value is a map\nwith all the fields and corresponding values that are updated. In our case, the\nremove set does not exist since nothing is meant to be removed, just edited. We\nmay mimic a remove by updating a field with a null value if necessary.\n\n## Schema\n\nThe schema to store this in SQLite.\n\n```sql\n\ncreate table changes(\n  -- This would be the personId in our case\n  entityId text,\n\n  -- Time when the event occurred\n  timestamp datetime,\n\n  -- json with fields that have changed and the corresponding values\n  -- eg. {'name': 'Name1', 'age': 22}, {'age': 29}\n  value text,\n);\n\n```\n\nHere’s a concise tech spec for “Grand Central.” It captures current stack choices and the target architecture, flags risks, and proposes guardrails.\n\n# 1) Overview\n\n* Purpose: Single source of truth for employee data. Visual analysis now. Workflow automation later.\n* Users: Internal staff. Auth via Google.\n* Non-goals: Public API, multi-tenant SaaS, heavy analytics.\n\n# 2) Core Requirements\n\n* CRUD for people and changesets.\n* Authenticated access only.\n* Visual graphs of trends.\n* Low-ops deploy. Small team ownership.\n* SQLite durability with simple backups. Path to Postgres when needed.\n\n# 3) Tech Stack (current)\n\n* Web framework: Remix (React + SSR). TypeScript everywhere.\n* Styling: Tailwind.\n* ORM: Prisma.\n* DB: SQLite (file URL defaults to `file:/data/sqlite.db`).\n* Auth: `remix-auth` + Google OAuth.\n* Charts: D3 components.\n* Testing: Vitest for unit, Cypress for E2E.\n* Packaging: Docker multi-stage build. Separate Datasette image for read/admin.\n* Runtime: Node process started by `start.sh` which runs `prisma migrate deploy` then `remix-serve`.\n* Ops: Procfile targets (`web`, `datasette`). Fly volume mounted at `/data`. Healthcheck at `/healthcheck`.\n  Sources: repo Dockerfiles, README, Fly config.&#x20;\n\n# 4) Architecture\n\n## 4.1 Logical components\n\n* **Remix app**\n\n  * Server routes: SSR HTML, actions for mutations, loaders for reads.\n  * Session: Cookie session storage.\n  * Auth: Google Strategy. On first login auto-creates user.\n  * Data access: Prisma client.\n  * Graphs: D3 line and multiseries components rendered client-side.\n* **SQLite**\n\n  * Deployed at `/data/sqlite.db` with a persistent volume.\n* **Datasette**\n\n  * Read and exploratory UI at `/datasette/`.\n  * Insert bot capability gated by token for controlled writes.\n* **Reverse proxy**\n\n  * Local dev uses Caddy via `docker-compose.local.yml` to route to Node and Datasette.\n\n## 4.2 Runtime topology\n\n* **Fly.io app**\n\n  * Service ports: 80/443 -> internal 8080.\n  * Volume mount `/data` for DB durability.\n  * Concurrency limits tuned to \\~20–25 connections.\n* **Datasette sidecar**\n\n  * Runs as a separate process/container when enabled.\n  * Base URL set to `/datasette/`.\n\n## 4.3 Request flow\n\n1. Browser → Remix route.\n2. Loader checks session. If needed, Google OAuth redirects.\n3. Loader/Action hits Prisma → SQLite.\n4. Response rendered via SSR + client hydration.\n5. Optional: Datasette used for admin/read operations.\n\n# 5) Configuration and Secrets\n\n* Required env:\n\n  * `SESSION_SECRET`\n  * `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`\n  * `APP_URL` (for OAuth callback)\n  * `DATABASE_URL` (defaults to `file:/data/sqlite.db`)\n  * `PORT` (default 8080)\n  * `INSERT_TOKEN` for Datasette insert bot\n* Secret handling: Store in Fly secrets or CI secrets. Never in repo. Rotate quarterly.\n\n# 6) Build and Deploy\n\n* **Build**: Multi-stage Docker builds:\n\n  * `deps` installs dev deps, `production-deps` prunes, `build` runs `prisma generate` and `npm run build`, final image copies `/build`, `/public`, `.prisma`.\n* **Start**: `start.sh` applies migrations then serves.\n* **Datasette image**: Minimal Python Alpine, installs `datasette`, `datasette-insert`, `datasette-auth-tokens`, serves `/data/sqlite.db`.\n* **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions push images to registry and deploy. Branching model: `dev` → staging, `main` → production.\n  Note: README mentions DigitalOcean registry and droplet; repo also contains `fly.toml`. Standardize on one target (recommend Fly for volume + healthchecks).\n\n# 7) Data Model and Migrations\n\n* ORM-driven schema via Prisma.\n* Migration policy:\n\n  * All schema changes via Prisma migrations committed to VCS.\n  * On boot, `prisma migrate deploy` runs. Fail fast if migration cannot be applied.\n* Backups:\n\n  * Nightly snapshot of `/data/sqlite.db` to object storage.\n  * Pre-migration snapshot in CI for production.\n\n# 8) Observability\n\n* Logs: stdout structured JSON from app. Retain 14–30 days in platform logs.\n* Health: `/healthcheck` HTTP 200.\n* Metrics (proposed):\n\n  * Basic RED metrics via runtime counters.\n  * Optionally expose `/metrics` for scrape.\n\n# 9) Security\n\n* HTTPS enforced.\n* Cookie `__session`: httpOnly, sameSite=lax, secure in production.\n* OAuth scopes: minimal email identity.\n* RBAC (future): roles for viewer, editor, admin.\n* Datasette:\n\n  * Base URL scoped under `/datasette/`.\n  * Token-gated inserts via `datasette-auth-tokens`.\n  * Default deny policy except for authenticated actor.\n\n# 10) Performance and Scale\n\n* SQLite fits current workload. Single writer, low read concurrency.\n* Concurrency guard at app level to avoid lock thrash.\n* Thresholds to move to Postgres:\n\n  * > 10 req/sec sustained writes.\n  * Multi-region rollout.\n  * Complex reporting joins.\n* Migration path:\n\n  * Replace `DATABASE_URL` to Postgres.\n  * Run Prisma `migrate deploy` on Postgres.\n  * Cutover via maintenance window.\n\n# 11) Testing Strategy\n\n* Unit: Vitest, `happy-dom` environment.\n* E2E: Cypress with `login()` helper and `cleanupUser()` per test file.\n* CI gates: typecheck, lint, unit, E2E against mocked services.\n\n# 12) Risks and Mitigations\n\n* **SQLite file lock contention** → keep mutations small; queue bulk imports; consider Postgres if contention spikes.\n* **Dual deployment targets confusion** → choose Fly or DO. Remove unused manifests.\n* **Secrets leakage** → enforce CI secret scanning; restrict Procfile usage in prod if not needed.\n\n# 13) Open Questions\n\n* Is Datasette exposed in production or only behind VPN?

I’ve included file and migration references so you can quickly verify.\n\nProduct–data model alignment\n- Prisma schema and migrations\n  - Current schema (prisma/schema.prisma) defines:\n    - User: id (cuid), email (unique), createdAt, updatedAt\n    - Changeset: id (cuid), entityId (String), createdByUserId (FK → User.id), occurredAt (DateTime), recordedAt (DateTime), value (String JSON)\n  - There is no Person table in the current schema.\n  - Migrations:\n    - 20230120092252_init: initially created User, Password, Person\n    - 20230125174823_add_changeset: created Changeset(id, entityId, timestamp, value)\n    - 20230128042107_update_changeset: replaced timestamp with occurredAt, recordedAt and createdByUserId, and added FK to User\n    - 20230223201415_drop_person_table: dropped Person\n    - 20230407085725_drop_user_password: dropped Password\n  - Person is defined as a Zod model for validation (app/models/person.ts) and materialized on the fly from Changesets in app/models/person.server.ts. No Prisma Person model/table exists now.\n  - If you plan to reintroduce Person:\n    - Option A: keep append-only Changeset and add a materialized read model for current snapshot (Person table) with trigger or job-based updates. Enforce DB constraints (unique workEmail, useful indexes).\n    - Option B: keep pure on-the-fly snapshots but add DB indexes and application-level uniqueness guarantees.\n\n- “Snapshot rule” implementation\n  - No materialized “current” snapshot. Snapshots are computed on the fly:\n    - getPersonCurrentSnapshot(personId): loads Changesets for entityId ordered by occurredAt ASC and reduces them (LWW merge) → app/models/person.server.ts\n    - getPersonSnapshots(personId): returns the series of snapshots over time from cumulative reduces → app/models/person.server.ts\n\n- workEmail uniqueness\n  - Not enforced at DB level (no Person table, Changeset.value is JSON).\n  - No explicit app-level uniqueness check found for workEmail on create/edit or import.\n  - Import scripts do not dedupe by workEmail; they rely on a provided entityId (scripts/import_changesets.ts).\n  - If required by PRD, you’ll need either:\n    - A materialized Person table with a unique index on workEmail; or\n    - Application logic checking “current” snapshot uniqueness before writing a new changeset (and ideally a DB constraint on a materialized view/table).\n\n- ID generation, FKs, indexes\n  - User.id and Changeset.id use Prisma default cuid() (schema.prisma).\n  - New person IDs (entityId) are generated via cuid2 (createId from @paralleldrive/cuid2) in createPersonUsingChangesets → app/models/person.server.ts.\n  - Changeset.createdByUserId has a foreign key to User (Restrict on delete/update).\n  - No DB index on Changeset.entityId or occurredAt. Time-travel queries always filter on entityId and order by occurredAt—indexes on (entityId, occurredAt) would help at scale.\n\nTemporal modeling details\n- effectiveDate vs recordedAt\n  - Changeset has occurredAt (effective time of change) and recordedAt (when we recorded it). This was introduced in 20230128042107_update_changeset replacing the earlier single “timestamp”.\n  - So “timestamp” previously was ambiguous; today, occurredAt is the effective time; recordedAt is the observed/ingestion time.\n\n- Timezones and boundaries\n  - Analytics group changes by year using UTC: getUTCFullYear and Date.UTC in app/models/graph.server.ts.\n  - Month boundary logic isn’t implemented; analytics are annual today.\n  - Back-dated changes: recomputation happens naturally because snapshots and analytics depend on occurredAt ordering—no materialized cache to invalidate.\n\n- Nulls/removals and conflict policy\n  - doc/modelling.md describes LWW-set with remove mimicked via nulls.\n  - In practice, many fields in the Zod person schema are required (z.string(), z.number()), and the edit path writes only changed fields as partial JSON; there’s no separate remove operation.\n  - Conflict policy is LWW by occurredAt then last reduce. No broader conflict resolution is implemented.\n\nAuth, RBAC, and security\n- Domain allowlist and Google SSO\n  - Google SSO: app/routes/auth/google.tsx and app/routes/auth/google/callback.tsx via remix-auth-google, configured in app/session.server.ts.\n  - Auto-provisioning: on first Google login, createUser(email) is called. No domain allowlist or env-based enforcement—any Google account can be provisioned if you can reach the callback URL.\n  - No env like ALLOWED_DOMAINS present.\n\n- Roles and enforcement\n  - No roles modeled in User; only id/email. No Admin/Viewer distinction in code. No role checks in loaders/actions; no export restriction by role.\n\n- Cookie/session hardening\n  - session cookie: httpOnly: true, sameSite: lax, secure in production. Good baseline.\n\n- Datasette exposure\n  - Caddy reverse-proxies /datasette/* publicly to the datasette container in both staging and production (deploy/grand-central/Caddyfile).\n  - Dockerfile.datasette includes datasette-auth-tokens and datasette-insert; metadata has:\n    - Top-level \"allow\": false\n    - datasette-auth-tokens with a token from env INSERT_TOKEN mapped to actor {bot: \"insert-bot\"}\n    - datasette-insert allow rules only for that bot.\n  - Net effect intended: deny by default; allow inserts only with the token; browsing likely denied, but verify in a running environment. There’s no app-level auth on the proxy, so your security depends on Datasette’s metadata.\n\nDirectory, person detail, and history\n- Routes\n  - Directory: app/routes/people.tsx (loader authorizes via authorize(request), then lists current snapshots). Uses getPersonListItemsUsingChangesets.\n  - Person detail: app/routes/people/$id.tsx. Shows a simple View/Edit toggle. No dedicated History tab; it displays fields from personCreateSchema only (not author or occurrence time).\n\n- History tab\n  - Not implemented. getPersonSnapshots exists in the model but is not used by the UI.\n\n- Append-only editing\n  - Edits create a new Changeset with the partial diff; no in-place updates to prior Changeset rows. There’s no DB constraint preventing updates/deletes, but app code only calls create on Changeset in edit flows.\n\n- Search behavior\n  - No search feature implemented. Directory loads all Changesets, groups, and sorts in-memory. Any future search needs case-insensitive matching and likely indexes or a materialized table for performance.\n\nImport and export\n- Importer\n  - scripts/import_changesets.ts provides:\n    - import-people: converts CSV rows (must include entityId) into initial Changesets; normalizes poshCertified and level (multiplies by 10 unless intern/ops-as-0).\n    - import-changes: converts change CSVs to Changesets; picks non-empty fields (\"\" trimmed) and multiplies level by 10 if provided.\n  - Re-runnable/idempotency:\n    - Not idempotent. Each run generates new Changeset ids and inserts again. No idempotency key or de-dupe.\n  - Dedupe by workEmail:\n    - Not implemented. The scripts filter only on non-empty entityId.\n  - Dry-run/validation:\n    - None beyond basic normalization; it logs and posts to Datasette’s insert endpoint.\n\n- CSV export\n  - Route: app/routes/people/csv.tsx.\n  - Exports only the current snapshots (via getPersonListItemsUsingChangesets).\n  - Headers are taken from Object.keys of the first person object—i.e., the keys of that snapshot, not fixed “Appendix A” headers. Order may vary; fields not present on the first object won’t be included.\n  - Date format: the code passes Date objects to csv-stringify; these are stringified to ISO strings by the library (verify if you need a specific format).\n\n- Mapping guide/enum normalization\n  - No documented mapping guide; importer normalizes a few legacy fields ad hoc (poshCertified string → boolean; level unit conversion; special case for interns and ops).\n\nAnalytics v0\n- Location\n  - Computations: app/models/graph.server.ts\n  - Routes: app/routes/graphs/people.tsx (turnover) and app/routes/graphs/levels.tsx (level vs experience; behind FEATURE_FLAGS includes \"levelChartEnabled\")\n  - Chart components: app/charts/* and app/components/graph.tsx (D3-based).\n\n- Definitions observed in code\n  - Headcount:\n    - Annual records. Active employees are those not RESIGNED (FULLTIME, PARTNER, DESIGN, etc. all count). Grouping by year (UTC). For each year, it tracks joiners (first seen that year) and leavers (status change to RESIGNED that year). Boundaries are by UTC year; monthly logic is not implemented.\n  - Joiners/leavers:\n    - Derived from occurredAt-year buckets. For a resignation, they add to leaving and remove from active. For a join, they add unless already active (with a subtle check to avoid counting rejoin after resign within same year before/after occurredAt).\n  - Level mix banding:\n    - Not implemented. No band or bucketing logic.\n  - Level vs prior experience scatter:\n    - Records per person snapshot where relevantWorkExperienceInYears is set. workExperience = initialRelevantWorkEx + (snapshot.occurredAt.year - firstSnapshot.year). level taken as-is (converted back to decimal in app). Nulls are filtered out for relevantWorkExperienceInYears; level can be undefined for some records.\n  - Volume testing:\n    - Logic is covered by unit tests (app/models/graph.server.test.ts). No explicit perf tests on real prod volumes.\n\nAudit logs and events\n- Audit logs\n  - The Changeset table is the audit log. It stores who (createdByUserId), what (value JSON diff), and when (occurredAt, recordedAt). No separate audit table or file/stream.\n\n- Event bus/hooks\n  - No event framework or explicit “person_created” event emission found.\n\nTesting and quality gates\n- Unit tests\n  - app/models/person.server.test.ts: create/edit/snapshot behaviors\n  - app/models/graph.server.test.ts: turnover and level/experience analytics\n  - app/utils.test.ts: email validator\n\n- E2E\n  - cypress/e2e/smoke.cy.ts: smoke; auth redirects and homepage links; relies on helpers to create/authenticate test users by directly setting the session cookie (cypress/support/create-user.ts).\n  - Test data isolation/reset: change deletions in afterEach(), user cleanup, and Prisma migrate reset in CI job.\n\n- CI\n  - GitHub Actions: lint + typecheck + cypress. The vitest step is present but disabled (if: false). Seeds present (prisma/seed.ts), and README describes setup.\n\nPerformance and ops\n- SQLite write concurrency\n  - Using SQLite; .env example sets connection_limit=1. No explicit batching/queuing; bulk inserts go through Datasette insert. For large imports, consider batching, WAL mode, and (entityId, occurredAt) index.\n\n- Backup and migration safety\n  - No backup strategy in repo. The DB is in a Docker volume (deploy docker-compose files). No automated pre-migration snapshot.\n\n- Deployment and secrets\n  - Deployment target: DigitalOcean droplet via docker-compose + Caddy (not Fly). The GitHub Actions workflow builds/pushes images to DO registry and then SSH-es to the droplet to pull and restart.\n  - Secrets: SESSION_SECRET, GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET, APP_URL, INSERT_TOKEN provided via Actions secrets/vars for staging and prod; DATABASE_URL is baked as file:/data/sqlite.db in image with volume mount for persistence.\n  - Healthcheck endpoint: /healthcheck (tests DB connectivity and self-HEAD) exists. No metrics surface observed.\n\nCode organization and patterns\n- Forms/actions\n  - Remix loaders/actions pattern with remix-forms and domain-functions wrappers:\n    - app/form.tsx and app/form-action.server.ts used in routes to validate and submit.\n  - Person routes use those helpers for create/edit.\n\n- Validation, enums, constants\n  - Zod schemas for domain model in app/models/person.ts (relationToCompany, role enums; create/edit schemas).\n  - Prisma-generated Zod for DB models at prisma/generated/zod.\n\n- UI components\n  - Tailwind configured. Reusable components in app/components/* (graph, person link).\n\nOpen decisions to settle before building\n- Exact enum mappings and level banding definitions (none codified today; importer has ad hoc rules).\n- RBAC scope for MVP (no roles exist; decide on Admin vs Viewer and where to enforce—e.g., export only for Admin).\n- Domain allowlist for Google SSO (currently any Google email is auto-provisioned).\n- Datasette exposure policy:\n  - It’s reverse-proxied at /datasette. Metadata suggests “deny by default; allow insert by token”, but confirm behavior. If browsing should be private, consider proxy auth or IP allowlists.\n- Materialize current snapshots or keep on-the-fly:\n  - Today is compute-on-read. If you need DB-level constraints (e.g., unique workEmail), or better performance and search, consider a materialized Person table with:\n    - Unique index on workEmail\n    - Indexes on entityId and occurredAt in Changeset\n    - Trigger/job to keep Person current in sync on insert.\n- Idempotent import semantics:\n  - If re-runs are expected, decide on an idempotency key (e.g., a composite of entityId+occurredAt+hash(value)) and upsert logic.\n- Search requirements:\n  - None today; decide case-insensitive/partial matching; likely need materialization and indexes.\n- Analytics definitions:\n  - Clarify “active” statuses, monthly vs yearly boundaries, edge inclusivity, and add level banding logic as per PRD.\n\nNotable gaps and quick wins\n- Add DB indexes on Changeset(entityId, occurredAt).\n- Enforce domain allowlist for Google SSO and add RBAC in User model.\n- Implement uniqueness guarantee for workEmail (materialized Person with unique index or app-level checks).\n- Make imports idempotent and optionally add a dry-run mode with validation report.\n- Lock down Datasette browsing explicitly (verify current “allow: false” behavior; if needed, gate behind auth or private network).\n- If CSV needs to match an Appendix A, define a fixed header order, formats (ISO 8601 for dates), and only export desired fields.\n- Turn vitest back on in CI (currently disabled) to keep unit tests running in PRs.\n</repository_context>\n</sources>\n\n<breakdown>\n- Read the product_requirements_document and the technical_specification_document, and break the problem down into smaller pieces.\n- The smaller pieces should be simpler for a developer to deal with, and easy to understand.\n- If the problem is CRUD like, create pieces for each command or query\n- As much as possible, each piece should also be valuable to the business.\n- One piece for one value.\n- Each piece should be structured as a User Story, which mentions the <persona>, <capability>, and <benefit>.\n- Look at all the stories, and then add relative estimates the stories to one of: [XS]/[S]/[M]/[L], and add that as a prefix.\n- Sort the stories in the order that they should be implemented.\n</breakdown>\n\n<reflection>\nInternally check before emitting:\n1) Coverage: every user-facing capability and acceptance test from sources appears in exactly one story (or a clearly split pair) with no gaps.\n2) Persona: each title uses a real end-user persona from sources.\n3) Title: states capability and benefit.\n4) Estimate: each story has a t-shirt size estimate prefixed\n5) AC: behavioral, testable, grounded in sources; permissions included where specified.\n6) No duplicates/overlaps; split or merge as needed to satisfy INVEST.\nDo not output this reflection.\n</reflection>\n"

          "text": "Here’s a focused checklist of questions to answer about the codebase before planning work for this PRD:\n\nProduct–data model alignment\n- Does the current Prisma schema match the PRD entities? Do we have Person and Changeset as described, or only a changes table? Where are they defined (prisma/schema.prisma) and how do existing migrations reflect that (prisma/migrations/…)? If Person was dropped (see 20230223201415_drop_person_table), what’s the plan to reintroduce/align?\n- How is the “snapshot rule” implemented today? Is there a materialized “current snapshot,” or computed on the fly in app/models/person.server.ts?\n- Is workEmail enforced unique at the DB level across snapshots? If there’s no Person table, how is uniqueness guaranteed?\n- How are IDs generated (cuid/uuid), and are foreign keys/indexes in place for performance on time-travel queries?\n\nTemporal modeling details\n- Where are effectiveDate vs recordedAt (createdAt) stored? Do we have both? Is “timestamp” in the changes table the effective time or the observed time?\n- What timezone rules are used for effective dates and month boundaries (UTC midnight)? How are back-dated changes handled in recomputing past views?\n- How are nulls/removals represented (LWW remove mimic)? Any conflicts policy beyond LWW?\n\nAuth, RBAC, and security\n- Where is domain allowlist implemented (env + enforcement) and how is Google SSO wired (app/routes/auth, app/session.server.ts)? Is first-login auto-provisioning restricted by domain?\n- How are roles modeled (Admin vs Viewer)? Where enforced in loaders/actions (export restricted to Admin)? Is there a field in User (app/models/user.server.ts)?\n- Cookie/session hardening: are httpOnly/sameSite/secure flags set in production?\n- Is Datasette exposed in prod? If yes, what auth proxy/token policy is enforced (datasette.metadata.json, Dockerfile.datasette)?\n\nDirectory, person detail, and history\n- Which routes back the Directory and Person detail (app/routes/people.tsx, app/routes/people/$id.tsx)? Is the History tab implemented and showing author/effectiveDate/fields changed?\n- Is editing append-only enforced in server actions (no in-place updates)? Where is the append-only guard?\n- Search behavior: case-insensitive? partial matches? performance implications on SQLite?\n\nImport and export\n- What’s the current importer path (scripts/import_changesets.ts vs building a UI at app/routes/…)? Is it one-time only or re-runnable idempotently? What’s the idempotency key?\n- How is dedupe by work email implemented? What happens on conflicts? Is there a dry-run/validation report?\n- CSV export route (app/routes/people/csv.tsx): does it exactly match Appendix A headers and output only the current snapshot? What is the date format?\n- Is there a mapping guide and enum normalization for legacy Sheets → Status/Level?\n\nAnalytics v0\n- Where are analytics computed (app/models/graph.server.ts; routes app/routes/graphs/people.tsx and /graphs/levels.tsx)? Do definitions match PRD:\n  - Headcount: which Status values count as “active”? Boundary rules per month?\n  - Joiners/leavers derived from start/end effective changes? Inclusive/exclusive month edges?\n  - Level mix banding logic (junior/mid/senior): where defined?\n  - Level vs prior experience scatter: which fields map and how are nulls treated?\n- Do charts use D3 components (app/charts/*) with data from loaders, and are they tested for real production data volumes?\n\nAudit logs and events\n- Where are audit logs written (table, file, stdout)? Is “who changed what and when” persisted with author identity?\n- The PRD mentions event person_created—do we have an event bus or analytics hook? Where is this emitted?\n\nTesting and quality gates\n- What unit/E2E coverage exists for people, history, import, export, analytics (app/models/*.test.ts, cypress/e2e/smoke.cy.ts)? What’s missing for PRD acceptance tests?\n- How does Cypress handle Google login (cypress/support/login helper)? How is test data isolated and reset?\n- Lint/typecheck/CI setup (GitHub Actions). Any required fixtures or seeds (prisma/seed.ts)?\n\nPerformance and ops\n- SQLite write concurrency: how are we avoiding locks during bulk import? Do we need batching/queuing?\n- Backup strategy for /data/sqlite.db and RPO/RTO. Is pre-migration snapshot automated?\n- Deployment target alignment (Fly vs DO) and secrets management (SESSION_SECRET, GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET, APP_URL, DATABASE_URL, INSERT_TOKEN). Which is canonical per CI workflow?\n- Healthcheck endpoint status and readiness (/healthcheck). Any metrics surface planned?\n\nCode organization and patterns\n- Where should new forms/actions live (Remix loaders/actions pattern)? Use existing helpers (app/form.tsx, app/form-action.server.ts)?\n- Validation strategy (Zod types in prisma/generated/zod). Where to centralize enum/constant definitions (Status, Levels)?\n- Reusable UI components conventions (Tailwind setup, app/components/*).\n\nOpen decisions to settle before building\n- Exact enum mappings and level banding.\n- RBAC scope in MVP (who can edit vs view).\n- Datasette exposure policy in non-dev environments.\n- Whether to materialize current snapshots for performance vs compute on the fly."

Create, edit, and view **person** records with append-only **changesets** and effective dates.\n2. **One-time bulk import** from Google Sheets with dedupe by work email.\n3. **Directory** with search and CSV export of the **current snapshot**.\n4. **Analytics v0:** monthly headcount, joiners vs leavers, level distribution over time; simple “level vs prior experience” view.\n5. **Security:** Google SSO, domain allowlist, audit log on writes.\n\n**Non-goals (MVP)**\n\n* Payroll, performance reviews, external HRIS sync.\n* Complex RBAC beyond Admin vs Viewer.\n* Compensation reporting UI. *Schema ready; UI deferred to v2.*\n\n**Why now**\n\n* Operational risk from spreadsheet fragmentation.\n* Quick wins unlock broader analytics later.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Requirements\n\n### 5.1 Functional\n\n* **Auth:** Google SSO; domain allowlist; logout; session security.\n* **Directory:** list with columns *Name, Work email, Level, Status, Start date*; search by name/email; link to person detail; CSV export of current snapshot.\n* **Person detail:** core fields, plus **History** tab showing changesets in reverse chronological order; show who changed what and when.\n* **Create/Edit:** forms capture effective dates; all edits append a changeset; current snapshot recomputed.\n* **Analytics v0:**\n\n  * *Headcount trend* by month (active count, joiners, leavers).\n  * *Level mix* over time (banded junior/mid/senior).\n  * *Level vs prior experience* scatter.\n* **Import:** one-time CSV importer for legacy Sheets; idempotent; validation report; dedupe by work email; mapping guide.\n\n### 5.2 Data model (MVP)\n\n* **Person**: id, firstName, lastName, workEmail (unique), phone?, role, level, status, startDate, endDate?, priorWorkExperienceYears.\n* **Changeset**: id, personId, field(s) changed, newValue, effectiveDate, author, createdAt.\n* **Status enum**: FULLTIME, CONTRACTOR, EXEC, PARTNER, RESIGNED.\n* **Compensation (v2-ready)**: CompChange(personId, amount, currency, effectiveDate, notes).\n* **Snapshot rule**: latest effective changes per field as of “now”.\n\n### 5.4 UX principles\n\n* Defaults fast data entry over perfect taxonomy.\n* Make history obvious before saving edits.\n* Show what changed, by whom, and when.\n\n---\n\n## 8) Risks and mitigations\n\n* **Import correctness** → schema mapping guide, dry-run, row-level report.\n* **Duplicate records** → unique email constraint; surface potential duplicates; merge flow later.\n* **Bad effective dates** → inline validation; preview of resulting history.\n* **OAuth misconfig** → automated env checks in CI; clear runbooks.\n\n---\n\n## 9) Acceptance tests (MVP)\n\n1. **Create person**: Authenticated user submits required fields → person appears in directory; audit entry created; event `person_created` emitted.\n2. **Edit with history**: Update level with effective date → new changeset stored; History tab shows entry; snapshot updated.\n3. **Import**: Run importer on validated CSV → ≥95% rows ingested; reconciliation report shows any rejects with reasons.\n4. **Export**: Click Export on directory → CSV downloads with one row per current person; header spec matches appendix.\n5. **Analytics**: Open Analytics → monthly headcount, joiners vs leavers, and level mix charts render from production data; “level vs experience” view loads.\n6. **Security**: Unauthenticated user → redirected to login; export requires Admin.\n\n---\n\n## 10) Open questions\n\n* Exact mapping of legacy Sheets to entities and enums.\n* Admin vs Viewer permissions beyond export.\n* Compensation governance and who can view amounts in v2.\n* Do managers need edit rights or view-only in v1?\n\n---\n\n## 11) Appendix\n\n**A. CSV header spec (current snapshot)**\n`firstName,lastName,workEmail,phone,role,level,status,startDate,endDate,priorWorkExperienceYears`\n\n**B. Glossary**\n\n* **Changeset**: append-only record of a field change with an effective date.\n* **Snapshot**: latest effective value per field at a point in time.\n* **Headcount**: number of active employees in a period.\n* **Joiners/Leavers**: counts of start/end effective events in a period.\n\n**C. Decision log**\n\n* Compensation UI deferred to v2; schema included now.\n* Unique workEmail enforced; no merge UI in v1.\n* SQLite acceptable for MVP, to be revisited post-M6.\n\n\n</product_requirements_document>\n\n<technical_specification_document>\n# Modelling\n\nDescribes how to model entities over time.\n\n## Goals\n\nModel an entity with a set of known fields which changes over time such that:\n\n1. The time when a change occurred is tracked separately from when the change\n   was recorded\n\n2. The state of an entity (a view) can be queried for any point in time to\n   fetch the values of fields in that entity at that point in time\n\n3. A change that occurred in the past should affect all views of the entity\n   that are requested after that point in time\n\n4. The end user should not have to declare changes but instead just edits the\n   entity as a whole at a given point in time\n\n## CRDTs\n\nRef: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type\n\nTypically used for resolving conflicts between information created from two different sources, we are able to use CRDTs for our usecase by treating a change made to an entity's history as a change from a disconnected user that's converging with other changes.\n\n### LWW Element Set\n\nRef: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type#LWW-Element-Set_(Last-Write-Wins-Element-Set)\n\nAn LWW Element Set is a well known CRDT. It consists of an 'add set', 'remove\nset' and a time stamp for each element in it.\n\nThe timestamp will be the time at which the change occurred. The value is a map\nwith all the fields and corresponding values that are updated. In our case, the\nremove set does not exist since nothing is meant to be removed, just edited. We\nmay mimic a remove by updating a field with a null value if necessary.\n\n## Schema\n\nThe schema to store this in SQLite.\n\n```sql\n\ncreate table changes(\n  -- This would be the personId in our case\n  entityId text,\n\n  -- Time when the event occurred\n  timestamp datetime,\n\n  -- json with fields that have changed and the corresponding values\n  -- eg. {'name': 'Name1', 'age': 22}, {'age': 29}\n  value text,\n);\n\n```\n\nHere’s a concise tech spec for “Grand Central.” It captures current stack choices and the target architecture, flags risks, and proposes guardrails.\n\n# 1) Overview\n\n* Purpose: Single source of truth for employee data. Visual analysis now. Workflow automation later.\n* Users: Internal staff. Auth via Google.\n* Non-goals: Public API, multi-tenant SaaS, heavy analytics.\n\n# 2) Core Requirements\n\n* CRUD for people and changesets.\n* Authenticated access only.\n* Visual graphs of trends.\n* Low-ops deploy. Small team ownership.\n* SQLite durability with simple backups. Path to Postgres when needed.\n\n# 3) Tech Stack (current)\n\n* Web framework: Remix (React + SSR). TypeScript everywhere.\n* Styling: Tailwind.\n* ORM: Prisma.\n* DB: SQLite (file URL defaults to `file:/data/sqlite.db`).\n* Auth: `remix-auth` + Google OAuth.\n* Charts: D3 components.\n* Testing: Vitest for unit, Cypress for E2E.\n* Packaging: Docker multi-stage build. Separate Datasette image for read/admin.\n* Runtime: Node process started by `start.sh` which runs `prisma migrate deploy` then `remix-serve`.\n* Ops: Procfile targets (`web`, `datasette`). Fly volume mounted at `/data`. Healthcheck at `/healthcheck`.\n  Sources: repo Dockerfiles, README, Fly config.&#x20;\n\n# 4) Architecture\n\n## 4.1 Logical components\n\n* **Remix app**\n\n  * Server routes: SSR HTML, actions for mutations, loaders for reads.\n  * Session: Cookie session storage.\n  * Auth: Google Strategy. On first login auto-creates user.\n  * Data access: Prisma client.\n  * Graphs: D3 line and multiseries components rendered client-side.\n* **SQLite**\n\n  * Deployed at `/data/sqlite.db` with a persistent volume.\n* **Datasette**\n\n  * Read and exploratory UI at `/datasette/`.\n  * Insert bot capability gated by token for controlled writes.\n* **Reverse proxy**\n\n  * Local dev uses Caddy via `docker-compose.local.yml` to route to Node and Datasette.\n\n## 4.2 Runtime topology\n\n* **Fly.io app**\n\n  * Service ports: 80/443 -> internal 8080.\n  * Volume mount `/data` for DB durability.\n  * Concurrency limits tuned to \\~20–25 connections.\n* **Datasette sidecar**\n\n  * Runs as a separate process/container when enabled.\n  * Base URL set to `/datasette/`.\n\n## 4.3 Request flow\n\n1. Browser → Remix route.\n2. Loader checks session. If needed, Google OAuth redirects.\n3. Loader/Action hits Prisma → SQLite.\n4. Response rendered via SSR + client hydration.\n5. Optional: Datasette used for admin/read operations.\n\n# 5) Configuration and Secrets\n\n* Required env:\n\n  * `SESSION_SECRET`\n  * `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`\n  * `APP_URL` (for OAuth callback)\n  * `DATABASE_URL` (defaults to `file:/data/sqlite.db`)\n  * `PORT` (default 8080)\n  * `INSERT_TOKEN` for Datasette insert bot\n* Secret handling: Store in Fly secrets or CI secrets. Never in repo. Rotate quarterly.\n\n# 6) Build and Deploy\n\n* **Build**: Multi-stage Docker builds:\n\n  * `deps` installs dev deps, `production-deps` prunes, `build` runs `prisma generate` and `npm run build`, final image copies `/build`, `/public`, `.prisma`.\n* **Start**: `start.sh` applies migrations then serves.\n* **Datasette image**: Minimal Python Alpine, installs `datasette`, `datasette-insert`, `datasette-auth-tokens`, serves `/data/sqlite.db`.\n* **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions push images to registry and deploy. Branching model: `dev` → staging, `main` → production.\n  Note: README mentions DigitalOcean registry and droplet; repo also contains `fly.toml`. Standardize on one target (recommend Fly for volume + healthchecks).\n\n# 7) Data Model and Migrations\n\n* ORM-driven schema via Prisma.\n* Migration policy:\n\n  * All schema changes via Prisma migrations committed to VCS.\n  * On boot, `prisma migrate deploy` runs. Fail fast if migration cannot be applied.\n* Backups:\n\n  * Nightly snapshot of `/data/sqlite.db` to object storage.\n  * Pre-migration snapshot in CI for production.\n\n# 8) Observability\n\n* Logs: stdout structured JSON from app. Retain 14–30 days in platform logs.\n* Health: `/healthcheck` HTTP 200.\n* Metrics (proposed):\n\n  * Basic RED metrics via runtime counters.\n  * Optionally expose `/metrics` for scrape.\n\n# 9) Security\n\n* HTTPS enforced.\n* Cookie `__session`: httpOnly, sameSite=lax, secure in production.\n* OAuth scopes: minimal email identity.\n* RBAC (future): roles for viewer, editor, admin.\n* Datasette:\n\n  * Base URL scoped under `/datasette/`.\n  * Token-gated inserts via `datasette-auth-tokens`.\n  * Default deny policy except for authenticated actor.\n\n# 10) Performance and Scale\n\n* SQLite fits current workload. Single writer, low read concurrency.\n* Concurrency guard at app level to avoid lock thrash.\n* Thresholds to move to Postgres:\n\n  * > 10 req/sec sustained writes.\n  * Multi-region rollout.\n  * Complex reporting joins.\n* Migration path:\n\n  * Replace `DATABASE_URL` to Postgres.\n  * Run Prisma `migrate deploy` on Postgres.\n  * Cutover via maintenance window.\n\n# 11) Testing Strategy\n\n* Unit: Vitest, `happy-dom` environment.\n* E2E: Cypress with `login()` helper and `cleanupUser()` per test file.\n* CI gates: typecheck, lint, unit, E2E against mocked services.\n\n# 12) Risks and Mitigations\n\n* **SQLite file lock contention** → keep mutations small; queue bulk imports; consider Postgres if contention spikes.\n* **Dual deployment targets confusion** → choose Fly or DO. Remove unused manifests.\n* **Secrets leakage** → enforce CI secret scanning; restrict Procfile usage in prod if not needed.\n\n# 13) Open Questions\n\n* Is Datasette exposed in production or only behind VPN? If exposed, add auth proxy.\n* Which registry is canonical: DOCR or Fly’s? Align CI/CD.\n* Backup RTO/RPO targets?\n\n# 14) Acceptance Criteria\n\n* Auth works with Google in staging and prod.\n* App boots with `prisma migrate deploy` and serves on 8080 behind TLS.\n* `/datasette/` loads with token auth.\n* E2E tests pass in CI on each PR to `dev` and `main`.\n\nSources: project Dockerfiles, Procfile, README, Fly config, package.json, Prisma bootstrap scripts.&#x20;\n\n\n</technical_specification_document>\n\n<repository_structure>\n.dockerignore\n.env.example\n.eslintrc.js\n.github/workflows/deploy.yml\n.gitignore\n.gitpod.Dockerfile\n.gitpod.yml\n.npmrc\n.prettierignore\nDockerfile\nDockerfile.datasette\nProcfile\nREADME.md\napp/charts/line-chart.ts\napp/charts/multiseries-chart.ts\napp/components/graph.tsx\napp/components/person.tsx\napp/db.server.ts\napp/entry.client.tsx\napp/entry.server.tsx\napp/form-action.server.ts\napp/form.tsx\napp/models/graph.server.test.ts\napp/models/graph.server.ts\napp/models/graph.ts\napp/models/person.server.test.ts\napp/models/person.server.ts\napp/models/person.ts\napp/models/user.server.ts\napp/root.tsx\napp/routes/auth/google.tsx\napp/routes/auth/google/callback.tsx\napp/routes/graphs/levels.tsx\napp/routes/graphs/people.tsx\napp/routes/healthcheck.tsx\napp/routes/index.tsx\napp/routes/login.tsx\napp/routes/logout.tsx\napp/routes/people.tsx\napp/routes/people/$id.tsx\napp/routes/people/csv.tsx\napp/routes/people/new.tsx\napp/session.server.ts\napp/utils.test.ts\napp/utils.ts\ncypress.config.ts\ncypress/.eslintrc.js\ncypress/e2e/smoke.cy.ts\ncypress/fixtures/example.json\ncypress/support/commands.ts\ncypress/support/create-user.ts\ncypress/support/delete-user.ts\ncypress/support/e2e.ts\ncypress/tsconfig.json\ndatasette.metadata.json\ndatasette/metadata.json\ndeploy/grand-central/Caddyfile\ndeploy/grand-central/Caddyfile.local\ndeploy/grand-central/docker-compose.caddy.yml\ndeploy/grand-central/docker-compose.local.yml\ndeploy/grand-central/docker-compose.staging.yml\ndeploy/grand-central/docker-compose.yml\ndoc/modelling.md\nfly.toml\nmocks/README.md\nmocks/index.js\npackage-lock.json\npackage.json\nprisma/generated/zod/index.ts\nprisma/migrations/20230120092252_init/migration.sql\nprisma/migrations/20230125174823_add_changeset/migration.sql\nprisma/migrations/20230128042107_update_changeset/migration.sql\nprisma/migrations/20230223201415_drop_person_table/migration.sql\nprisma/migrations/20230407085725_drop_user_password/migration.sql\nprisma/migrations/migration_lock.toml\nprisma/schema.prisma\nprisma/seed.ts\npublic/favicon.ico\npublic/grand-central.jpg\nremix.config.js\nremix.env.d.ts\nscripts/import_changesets.ts\nstart.sh\ntailwind.config.js\ntest/global-setup.ts\ntest/setup-test-env.ts\ntsconfig.json\nvitest.config.ts\n</repository_structure>\n"
